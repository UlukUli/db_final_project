 1)Primary Keys (PRIMARY KEY)

Each table has a PRIMARY KEY, which:

uniquely identifies each record,

automatically creates a clustered index,

speeds up JOIN operations between tables.

This is the foundation of a normalized database schema

   

2)Foreign Keys (FOREIGN KEY)

Every foreign key is automatically indexed by MySQL.
This speeds up connections between tables, such as:

bookings.hotel_id

bookings.customer_id

bookings.reserved_room_id

bookings.meal_id
   
   
3)Indexes on frequently filtered columns

is_canceled

arrival_date_year

arrival_date_month

market_segment_id

distribution_channel_id

Reason: analysts often ask questions like:
“How many bookings were canceled?”, “How many bookings were in 2017?”, “How many bookings by market segment?


4)Indexes to speed up sorting and aggregation

For example:

lead_time

adr

booking_changes

These fields are used for statistics and visualizations, so indexing them reduces computational cost.
